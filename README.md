This project provides an engaging opportunity to apply the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and experiment with multiple classification algorithms on the Mushrooms dataset (available on Kaggle). The dataset contains 8,143 observations and 23 descriptive features, categorizing mushrooms into two distinct classes: edible and poisonous.

To predict the binary classes (edible vs. poisonous), we experimented with a diverse set of machine learning algorithms and later identified the best-performing model. The algorithms evaluated include:

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

XGBoost
